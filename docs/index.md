# Welcome to the documentation for PlantCV-Annotate

## Overview

[PlantCV-annotate](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv-annotate) is composed of modular functions in order to be applicable to a 
variety of plant types and imaging systems. In the following documentation we will describe use of each function and 
provide tutorials on how each function is used in the context of an overall image-processing workflow. Development of 
PlantCV-Annotate is ongoing---we encourage input from the greater plant phenomics community. Please post questions and comments 
on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv-annotate/issues).
